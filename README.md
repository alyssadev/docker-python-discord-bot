python-discord-bot
==================

Usage
-----

Current version (`latest`) has discord-py-interactions and discord.py only:

```docker
FROM ghcr.io/alyssadev/python-discord-bot:latest
```

A previous version had a bunch of stuff for a radio bot I was working on. This version is not supported. You can use it with:

```docker
FROM ghcr.io/alyssadev/python-discord-bot:v1.0.13
```

The source for this image is on the radio tag: https://github.com/alyssadev/python-discord-bot/tree/radio
